# Introduction

I've gathered most of my learning and hard-earned lessons from working with dapr in this documentation site.

Since dapr is quite new, tools and services are still being developed and a lot of common scenarios aren't well-documented
yet. So, this is an attempt at gathering my learnings in one place.
